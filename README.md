WakeBlock is an app that, through a system modification, allows users to block or limit any system wakelock, without the need of any kind of framework.

This modification can be applied systemless-ly with Magisk, by creating the Magisk Module from inside the app.

The app is currently in beta stage, so is missing many features we plan to implement in future releases.
